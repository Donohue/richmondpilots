<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p class="sub">
          Richmond Pilots is a 503(c)(7) equity based flight club in the NY/NJ area that owns two instrument capable Cessna 172s. The club is a non profit organization, run entirely by its members, and does not provide any commmercial services. Membership is a great alternative to paying FBO prices which are typically twice as much as club rates for the same aircraft. Richmond Pilots has been in continuous operation since its formation in 1968 at <a href="http://www.airfields-freeman.com/NY/Airfields_NY_NY_StatenI.htm#miller" target="_blank">Miller Field</a> in Richmond County (Staten Island). When Miller Field closed, the club moved to its current location at <a href="https://www.airnav.com/airport/KLDJ" target="_blank">Linden Airport</a> in NJ.
