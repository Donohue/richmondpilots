# Richmond Pilots

Website for Richmond Pilots, a 503(c)(7) equity-based flight club in the NY/NJ area.

## About

Richmond Pilots is a non-profit organization, run entirely by its members, that owns two instrument-capable Cessna 172s. The club has been in continuous operation since its formation in 1968 at Miller Field in Richmond County (Staten Island). When Miller Field closed, the club moved to its current location at [Linden Airport](https://www.airnav.com/airport/KLDJ) in NJ.

Membership is a great alternative to paying FBO prices, which are typically twice as much as club rates for the same aircraft. The club does not provide any commercial services.

## Meetings

- **When**: 2nd Tuesday of the month at 7:30 pm
